# 🏦 Loan Inquiry System

This project is an **improved version** of my **internship project**. It was originally built with **Java Swing**, and now it uses **Spring Boot & Hibernate** for a modern backend.

## 🔹 Features

- **CRUD operations**: Add, update, delete, and view loan inquiries
- **Validations** to ensure correct data input
- **Spring JPA** for easy database handling
- **RESTful APIs** for managing loan inquiries
- **Safe & secure database handling**

## 💻 Skills & Technologies

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring JPA / Hibernate**
- **Data validation using Jakarta Validation**
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL (or any RDBMS)**

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Going to **add Spring Security** with **JWT** for authentication and authorization
- Going to **build a React frontend** for a complete full-stack application
